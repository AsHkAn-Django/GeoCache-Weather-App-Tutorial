# GeoCache-Weather-App

An advanced weather application that auto-detects the user's location using HTML5 Geolocation API and leverages Django's caching framework to optimize performance. This project enhances a simple weather API by integrating geo-location for personalized data and implementing caching for faster load times.

## Overview

The GeoCache-Weather-App is designed to provide an optimized weather experience by:
- Automatically detecting the user's location through the HTML5 Geolocation API.
- Fetching real-time weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- Using Django's caching framework to temporarily store API responses, reducing load times and API calls.
- Displaying personalized weather information that includes temperature, humidity, conditions, and more.

This project builds upon a simple weather API by adding dynamic geo-location and performance optimizations through caching.

## Features

- **Geo-Location Detection:**  
  Automatically retrieves the user's geographic coordinates using the HTML5 Geolocation API.
  
- **Weather API Integration:**  
  Fetches and displays accurate weather data including temperature, humidity, and conditions.
  
- **Django Caching:**  
  Implements caching strategies to store API responses temporarily, reducing latency and improving overall app performance.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  A mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python, Django  
- **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap API (or a similar weather data provider)  
- **Performance:** Django Caching Framework

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GeoCache-Weather-App.git
   cd GeoCache-Weather-App
2. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   
   Create a .env file or set the required environment variables in your system. At a minimum, you might need:
   - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
   - OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY
   - Other environment-specific settings for caching and deployment.

4. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

After installation, the app will:

- Prompt the user to allow location access via the browser.
- Retrieve weather data based on the detected coordinates.
- Display weather information in a clean, responsive layout.
- Use caching to optimize performance by storing frequent API responses for a configurable duration.
